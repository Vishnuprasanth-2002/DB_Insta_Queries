# task

1. list all users `SELECT * from users;`

2. list all posts `SELECT * from posts`

3. List posts that are liked by colin `select posts.post_content as liked_By_Colin from posts left join likes on posts.post_id = likes.post_id where likes.user_id = 2;`

4. As a Glenda, she wants to know who are all liked her post book. `select users.name as glendas_post_book_liked_by from users inner join likes on users.user_id=likes.user_id where likes.post_id=13;`

5. Edina needs to know the post count which are liked by others. `SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT posts.post_id) liked_posts_count FROM posts inner join likes on posts.post_id=likes.post_id where posts.user_id = 1;`

6. Paula needs to check the count of awarness and trickes likes count, here awarness id is 17 and trickes id is 20.`SELECT posts.post_content, COUNT(likes.like_id) FROM posts LEFT JOIN likes ON posts.post_id = likes.post_id WHERE posts.post_id IN (17, 20) GROUP BY posts.post_content;`
7. List Posts of Edina which has likes and also not liked posts.
   `SELECT
    p.post_id,
    p.post_content,
    CASE WHEN COUNT(l.like_id) > 0 THEN 'Liked' ELSE 'Not Liked' END AS like_status
FROM
    posts p
LEFT JOIN
    likes l ON p.post_id = l.post_id
WHERE
    p.user_id = (SELECT user_id FROM users WHERE name = 'Edina')
GROUP BY
    p.post_id, p.post_content
ORDER BY
    like_status;`

8. Search all users posts with Text "sal"

The LIKE operator is case sensitive, if you want to do a case insensitive search, use the ILIKE operator instead.

`SELECT * FROM posts WHERE posts.post_content ILIKE '%sal%';`

9. Get the count of colin posts
   `SELECT COUNT(posts.post_id) AS no_of_colin_post FROM posts WHERE  posts.user_id=2;`

10. Get count of likes for the post cartoon. user colin
    `select COUNT(likes.like_id) AS cartoon_likes_count from likes where likes.post_id = 7;`

11. Get the maximum likes posts.
    `select p.post_content, count(l.like_id) like_count 
from posts p 
left join likes l on p.post_id=l.post_id 
group by p.post_content
order by like_count desc 
limit 2;`

12. In Edina, sort posts by title in forward.
    post content is ordered by ascending order for the user edina.
    `select * from posts where user_id=1 ORDER BY post_content;`

13. In Paula, sort post by date backward.
    `select * from posts where user_id=4 ORDER BY post_date DESC;`

14. Filter today posted posts.
    `select * from posts where post_date= 'today';`
